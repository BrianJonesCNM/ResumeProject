# Resume Project

The task is to create an online version of your resume. 

## Tasks
1. Your resume must be complete. e.g. Applicant, Education, Jobs, Duties, References
2. Your complete resume must be displayed on a single page -- preferably nicely styled but not required.
3. All of the major entities of your Resume must be editable (Create, Retreive, Update, Delete) by an admnistrator. Drop down lists should be used to handle any Foreign Keys.
4. Only a logged in user (administrator) can edit an entity.
5. Links to manage your entities must be hidden unless the user it logged in.
6. Every table must be appropriately seeded and foreign keys inserted as necessary.
7. At least one 3rd party authorization system must be used
8. You must be able to complete the basic tasks with minimal support. Asking questions is expected. The questions will need to be specific and once answered you should be able to complete similar tasks on the rest of the entities.
